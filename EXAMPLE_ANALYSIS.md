## Sample Output

### 📊 Overall Health Score: 7/10

### 📋 Summary
Your Pitta dosha is showing signs of aggravation due to the hot summer weather in Mumbai. The humid conditions are further increasing heat in your body. Your food choices are generally good, but some modifications can help cool your system. Continue your yoga practice and consider evening walks instead of midday to avoid peak heat.

### 🧘 Body Analysis

**Dosha Balance:** Pitta is slightly elevated due to summer heat and humid weather. Vata and Kapha are in balance.

**Current State:** Your body is experiencing mild Pitta aggravation, manifesting as acidity and feeling warm. This is common during Mumbai summers for Pitta-dominant individuals.

**Recommendations:**
1. Incorporate cooling practices like Sheetali pranayama (cooling breath)
2. Apply coconut oil to the scalp before bed to reduce heat
3. Drink coriander water throughout the day
4. Avoid spicy and fried foods
5. Practice meditation during the cooler parts of the day

### 🌤️ Weather & Location Analysis

**Seasonal Impact:** Summer naturally aggravates Pitta dosha. The combination of heat and humidity in Mumbai creates an environment that increases internal heat, digestive fire (Agni), and can lead to irritability, acidity, and skin issues.

**Weather Advisory:** The humid conditions prevent proper heat dissipation from the body. Stay hydrated with room-temperature water (not ice-cold), wear light cotton clothing, and avoid direct sun exposure between 11 AM - 4 PM.

**Location Recommendations:**
- Mumbai's coastal location provides some relief - spend time near the sea during early morning or evening
- Use natural cooling methods like sandalwood paste on forehead
- Keep indoor spaces well-ventilated
- Consider using a clay water pot (matka) for drinking water - it naturally cools water

### 🍽️ Food Analysis

**Timing Score:** 8/10 - Your meal timing is good. Lunch at midday aligns with peak Agni (digestive fire).

**Suitability:** Your food choices are mostly Pitta-pacifying. Idli, coconut chutney, rice, dal, and curd are all cooling foods suitable for summer and your dosha. However, the mixed vegetables may have included some heating vegetables.

**Suggested Modifications:**
1. Add fresh cilantro (coriander leaves) to your dal and rice
2. Include cucumber raita with lunch instead of plain curd
3. Add fennel seeds to your meals or chew after eating
4. Avoid tomatoes, garlic, and onions during peak summer
5. Include sweet fruits like melons, grapes, and coconut water
6. Add ghee (clarified butter) to rice - it's cooling for Pitta
7. Drink mint-infused water throughout the day

### 💊 Medicine Analysis

**Overall Safety:** Your current supplement regimen is safe and appropriate. No concerning interactions detected.

**Interactions:**

🟢 **Vitamin D - SAFE**
Vitamin D supplementation is beneficial, especially if you're avoiding peak sun hours. No interactions with Ayurvedic principles. Take with a meal containing healthy fats for better absorption.

🟢 **Omega-3 - SAFE**
Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties that can help balance Pitta. They support heart health and reduce inflammation. No contraindications for your dosha type.

**Recommendations:**
- Take Vitamin D in the morning with breakfast
- Omega-3 can be taken with any meal
- Consider adding Amla (Indian gooseberry) supplement - it's excellent for Pitta balance
- Triphala at bedtime can help with digestion and cooling
